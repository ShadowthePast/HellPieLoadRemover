# HellPieLoadRemover

To use in LiveSplit, enter the name of the game as Hell Pie, and then click activate.

The timer will automatically pause on load screens, the pause menu (including map/skill tree menus), and the main menu (it will briefly unpause during transitions, this is normal).

The timer will start upon starting a new save from the main menu (and probably when loading a normal save as well). Turn it on/off in Settings.

Not extensively tested, so there may be edge cases not accounted for, particularly All Ing/100%. Report any issues to me.
